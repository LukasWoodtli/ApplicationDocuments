- [Encapsulate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28computer_programming%29) what varies ([Encapsulation Is Not Information Hiding](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?EncapsulationIsNotInformationHiding))
- [Prefer Composition to inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)
- Program to Interface, not Implementation: [Liskov substitution principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
- [Cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_%28computer_science%29): Objects should only interact with 'friends' (objects in their neighborhood)
- Ineracting Objects should aim for [loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling)
- [Open-Closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle): Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification
- [Tell don't ask](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TellDontAsk.html): Tell Objects what to do with their data, don't ask for the data to operate on it
- [Single-Responibility-Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle): A class should have only one responsibility (one reason to change)
