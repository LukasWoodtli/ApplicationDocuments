# Programming Languages

My main (and favourite) programming language is C++. I have also been programming C for several years. For small tasks I like Python. It's a tool I use regularly in my development workflow. I have tried some other languages. But I have not a lot experience in programming with them. My latest discovery is Clojure. I realy enjoy learning the functional progamming paradigm.

# Frameworks

I'm a big fan of the Qt framework. For bigger projects Boost is a must. And of course I know the standard libraries of the programming languages I use. For OS X and iOS GUI development I'd use Cocoa (Touch).

| Framework                                | Knowledge                                |

| STL                                      | good                                     |
| Boost                                    | basic                                    |
| Cocoa Touch                              | basic                                    |

# IDE's

For each project there is an IDE that suits the task best. I really like Visual Studio. But also XCode and Qt Creator are enjoyable.

| IDE                                      | Knowledge                                |

| Visual Studio                            | very good                                |

| Eclipse                                  | good                                     |


# OS's

I really like the Unix/Linux flavoured OS's. The shell is really enjoyable to work with and there are many cli tools included. My favourite is OS X since it combines the power of Unix with an easy and nice interface. But I'm also familiar with Windows.

| OS                                       | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| OS X                                     | very good                                |
| Linux                                    | good                                     |
| Windows                                  | good                                     |

# Build Tools

IDE's are nice. But often they are not flexible enough. So I prefer a platform independent build tool (CMake) and a proven CI build server (Jenkins).

| Tool                                     | Knowledge                                |

| Travis CI                                | very good                                |
| Jenkins                                  | very good                                |
| Gerrit                                   | good                                     |


# Unit Tests

Unit tests are of great importance for bug free software. Which tool to use is not of big importance. But doing tests is.

| Test Tool                                | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Catch                                    | very good                                |
| Google Test                              | basic                                    |
| Qt Test                                  | good                                     |
| Test Coverage (gcov & gcovr)             | good                                     |
| boost::di (dependency injection)         | good                                     |


# Skills
There are a lot of skills and tools that a developer needs to do his work.

# Documentation

Documenting the code is very important. Generally I use the de facto standard Doxygen. A wiki is also a very good tool for development documentation.

| Tool                                     | Knowledge                                |

# Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis (profiling) is an very important tool for checking and improving the code. It's something I want to improve in my feature projects.

| Tool                                     | Knowledge                                |

# Version Control
I really like Git. It's the version control system I use for all my projects. SVN is good, too. But it lacks some important features.

| VCS                                      | Knowledge                                |
