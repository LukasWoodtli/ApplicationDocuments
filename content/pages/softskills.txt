- communicative, team player
- like to solve problems together with others but also alone
- dutiful, responsible, initiative
- I usually try to avoid conflicts in the first place since I don't like solving them when it's too late
- Development (especially SW) is an active and agile field. Planning and organization works good with methods and tools
