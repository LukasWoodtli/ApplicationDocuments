Statistics and Probability
==========================

![Statistics and Probability]({filename}/images/statistics_probability.svg)


Independent Events
==================

- Probability of Event: P
- Probability of opposite Event: 1-P
- Probability of composit Events: P * P * ... * P


Dependent Events
================

P(A|B): Probability of Event A when B already occured.


Bayes Rule
==========

> Prior Probability  & Test Evidence -> Posterior Probability

* P(A), the prior, is the initial degree of belief in A.
* P(A | B), the posterior, is the degree of belief having accounted for B.
* the quotient P(B | A)/P(B) represents the support B provides for A.



P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
