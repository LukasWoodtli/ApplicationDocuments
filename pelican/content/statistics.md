Statistics and Probability
==========================

Independent Events
==================

- Probability of Event: $P$
- Probability of opposite Event: $1-P$
- Probability of composit Events: $P \cdot P \cdot ... \cdot P$


Dependent Events
================

$P(A\mid B)$: Probability of Event $A$ when $B$ already occured.


Bayes Rule
==========

> Prior Probability  & Test Evidence -> Posterior Probability

* $P(A)$: the prior, is the initial degree of belief in $A$.
* $P(A \mid B)$: the posterior, is the degree of belief having accounted for $B$.
* the quotient $\frac{P(B \mid A)}{P(B)}$ represents the support $B$ provides for $A$.


$$P(A\mid B) \; = \; \frac {P(B\mid A) \cdot P(A)} {P(B)}$$
