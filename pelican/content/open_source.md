# Open Source, Free Software, Proprietary and Companies interests

I'm a big fan of Open Source/Free Software. I'm also very exited how many projects are arround and widley used and supported. But I also observe the fear of companies with a more traditional background to touch anything that has to do with open source let alone to put some of their work into the public.

#Open Source or Free Softwar or Beer or Speech or Gratis or ...

All this different expressions for the same concepts are just confusing. And arguing about them doesn't help to make the idea behind this buzzwords

to get a broader acceptance. I just use the different terms interchageably.


# Permissive Copy Left/Right

There are a lot of confusing different license strategies. If a new project is started it's important choose (or define an new) license carefully. It not only gives the initiator of the project the legal security, but it is also a statement to the public. Of course the Copy Left licenses are the real ...


companies might consider to use open source with a permessive license than an copy left one since they don't need to make their source open source... they might even do some improvements that then get's back to the comunity (if they fulfill the permessive license). And it could even happen that they consider to give the comunity something back and release some library or tool to the public.


companies should open source at least libraries/frameworks => improvements from comunity, is architecture usable for other projects => so it's flexible and extensible
