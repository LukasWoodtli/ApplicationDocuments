This page is about my profesional life as a developer. Im mainly a software/firmware developer. But I know also quite some things about mechanical and electronical engineering.

There is an overview about my [curriculum vitae]({filename}/pages/cv.md) and my main [skills]({filename}/pages/skills.md). There are also some notes about my [knowledge]({filename}/pages/books.md) and what I've [learned]({filename}/pages/courses.md) so far.

I also write casually some small [blog](/pages/blog.md) articles.

Feel free to [contact]({filename}/pages/contact.md) me.
