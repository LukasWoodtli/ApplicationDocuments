Title: Note to Recruiters and Headhunters

If you are a recruiter (headhunter) and are looking to hire me, please read this page before contacting me.

I'm currently *not* looking for a new job. But I'm always open for new interesting challenges.


There are some requirements that a new position has to meet to catch my attention:


## Musts:

- C/C++: I'm very interested in other languages too, but C++ is my favorite language.
- Working site in ZÃ¼rich or near (max. 30 minutes by public transport): I just don't like to lose too much time commuting.
- Possibility to work part time (80%): This is an absolute must. I have a family that I need to take care of.
- Possibility to work from home occasionally (home office): I prefer to work on site. But sometimes it's just convenient to work from home.


## Mustn't:

- no .NET (C#, Visual Basic, F#): I just don't like it! I won't take any job that contains .NET development!
- no Windows centric development: It's just not as nice and powerful as UNIX/Linux and it lacks a lot of important tools
- I'll never work for the weapons industry: I don't like wars!


## Nice to have

- Possibility to make sport (jogging in the neighborhood, showers)
- Team leading position
