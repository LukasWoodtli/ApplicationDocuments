# Programming Languages

My main (and favourite) programming language is C++. I have also been programming C for several years. For small tasks I like Python. It's a tool I use regularly in my development workflow. I have tried some other languages. But I have not a lot experience in programming with them. My latest discovery is Clojure. I realy enjoy learning the functional progamming paradigm.

| Language                                 | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

| C++                                      | very good                                |
| Python                                   | good                                     |
| Objective C                              | basic                                    |
| JavaScript                               | basic                                    |
| Java                                     | basic                                    |
| Assembler (x86)                          | basic                                    |
| Clojure (Lisp)                           | basic                                    |


# Frameworks

I'm a big fan of the Qt framework. For bigger projects Boost is a must. And of course I know the standard libraries of the programming languages I use. For OS X and iOS GUI development I'd use Cocoa (Touch).

| Framework                                | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Qt                                       | very good                                |
| Boost                                    | good                                     |
| STL                                      | good                                     |
| Cocoa Touch                              | basic                                    |


# IDE's

For each project there is an IDE that suits the task best. I really like Visual Studio. But also XCode and Qt Creator are enjoyable.

| IDE                                      | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| XCode                                    | basic                                    |
| Visual Studio                            | very good                                |
| IAR Studio                               | very good                                |
| Qt Creator                               | very good                                |
| Eclipse                                  | basic                                    |


# OS's

I really like the Unix/Linux flavoured OS's. The shell is really enjoyable to work with and there are many cli tools included. My favourite is OS X since it combines the power of Unix with an easy and nice interface. But I'm also familiar with Windows.

| OS                                       | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| OS X                                     | very good                                |
| Linux                                    | good                                     |
| Windows                                  | good                                     |


# Build Tools

IDE's are nice. But often they are not flexible enough. So I prefer a platform independent build tool (CMake) and a highly cusomisable build server (Buildbot).

| Tool                                     | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| CMake                                    | good                                     |
| Buildbot                                 | basic                                    |
| Travis CI                                | basic                                    |


# Unit Tests

Unit tests are of great importance for bug free software. Which tool to use is not of big importance. But doing tests is.

| Test Harness                             | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Google Test                              | basic                                    |
| Qt Test                                  | good                                     |
| Test Coverage (gcov & lcov)              | basic                                    |


# Skills
There are a lot of skills and tools that a developer needs to do his work.

| Skill                                            | Knowledge                                |

| Project Management / Scrum / XP                  | very good                                |
| Legacy Code (refactoring, testing, improving...) | very good                                |


# Documentation

Documenting the code is very important. Generally I use the de facto standard Doxygen. A wiki is also a very good tool for development documentation.

| Tool                                     | Knowledge                                |

| Graphviz                                 | very good                                |
| MediaWiki                                | good                                     |


#Static Analysis
Static analysis is one of the important tools to improve code quality.

| Analysis Tool                            | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| OCLint                                   | basic                                    |
| CppCheck                                 | good                                     |


# Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis (profiling) is an very important tool for checking and improving the code. It's something I want to improve in my feature projects.

| Tool                                     | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

| Instruments (XCode)                      | basic                                    |


# Version Control
I really like Git. It's the version control system I use for all my projects. SVN is good, too. But it lacks some important features.

| VCS                                      | Knowledge                                |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Git                                      | good                                     |
| SVN                                      | very good                                |
